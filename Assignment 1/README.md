# Assignment 2
Contains the code for Assignment 1 where I had to implement a LinkedList data structure to create a simple word processor:
1. The user inputs a sentence and the program will store it into the data structure, display the contents, number of words, and how many times  "SENG1120" occurs. 
2. It then asks for a second input which will be concatenated to the first input, and displays the length and occurences of 'is'. 
3. Lastly, it will delete all occurences of an input word from the second input.
